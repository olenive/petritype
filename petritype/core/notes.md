# TODO:

## Distribution Funciton VS Edge Declaration
When an `output_distribution_function` is provided, are the declared edges ignored - can the
`output_distribution_function` potentially deliver tokens to any place node?
[.] Figure out what can and should be possible...
[.] Implement guardrails.
[.] Try to find elegant syntax that links the `output_distribution_function` to edge declaration?
